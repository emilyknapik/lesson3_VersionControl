            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a type of system that helps a team manage a source code and it's changes over time. This software helps keep track of all of the types of changes and modifications that are made over a period of time. This system helps to keep track of who changed the files, when, what changed, and then is merged into the same file. This is very important and helps in software development and in this class because it causes no files to be overwritten, and helps to hold a common repository with all of the files. This system is great and very beneficial so you do not lose any file and everything stays backed up.</p>

            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a type of server that is most commonly used among several members.This type of repository is very helpful when people are working on a project together and want to be able to share all of their data they have found and collected. These type of servers are easy and helpful in this class and in the real world since it is accessible for all of the team members on that server. This is very helpful with developers who are sharing and exchanging codes with one another, while using these types of servers.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local repositories are a little different from remote repositories in many ways. A local repository is a server that is just used when it has only one individual user. These are just specifically used for individual team members and not the entire team. All of the work that is made on someones individual project is made and resides in this local repository. Some of the ways one can obtain a local repository is to either create a new one or clone one from an existing remote repository. These are very helpful and interesting since it helps people create their own repository when working on an individual project.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a type of version control system that is very commonly used. Many software projects rely on using GIT for version control. Within GIT, every single developers copy of their code is also a repository. In these repositories, is where all of the history of all of the changes that has been done within that repository. GIT is a great type of system because it is able to make changes, merge changes, and help compare last versions, which makes the job for the developer much easier and much more efficient. GIT system is very focused on the files and content in the files itself. This is useful in this class just as we used it in Lesson 3. It was very easy to use in a simple and efficient way. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Within GIT, there are many commands that are used to perform certain actions. Some of the most commonly used commands show GIT who the user is, creating a new local repository, adding files, connecting to other remote repositories, creating branches, updating, and so much more. These simple commands are easy to use and perform many actions. I thought that these GIT command actions that were used in the assignment in this lesson were very interesting and easy to navigate. I found it very helpful that just a simple command can perform so many actions. This sytem of GIT is overall very helpful and efficient.</p>
